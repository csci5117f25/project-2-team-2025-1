## App Info:

* Team Name: Team-2025😅
* App Name: CourtVision - A Personal Athlete Performance Tracker
* App Description:
    CourtVision is a personalized sports performance management application designed for sports team coaches, athletes, and sports enthusiasts. Users can create and manage their own teams, view each athlete's profile, game data, and video highlights, and analyze performance more deeply through visual charts, game logs, and frame-by-frame video notes.

    Unlike traditional sports statistics tools, CourtVision integrates video flagging, game data visualization, and personal sports notes into a mobile-friendly single-page application, enabling users to privately record and analyze sports performance, making training and review more efficient.

## Key Features

**Describe the most challenging features you implemented
(one sentence per bullet, maximum 4 bullets):**

* Implemented a dynamic team management system where users can create teams, add athletes, and view individual player dashboards powered by Firestore’s real-time data sync.

* Built an interactive video note-taking tool that supports time-based markers (“flags”) and custom annotations directly tied to specific video timestamps.

* Designed athlete statistics dashboards using Firestore collections and auto-updating chart components to visualize per-game and per-season performance metrics.

* Integrated a media-driven highlight gallery that supports video uploading, storage linking, and per-player video categorization.

Which (if any) device integration(s) does your app support?

* Camera API for capturing game highlights or practice clips directly from the user’s device and uploading them into the athlete’s highlight library.

Which (if any) progressive web app feature(s) does your app support?

* Add-to-Home-Screen support allowing the app to behave like a native sports tracker on mobile devices.
* Offline caching for static routes/pages, improving load experience during weak network conditions such as in gymnasiums or training centers.
